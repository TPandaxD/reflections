How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Git makes viewing files easier because it only shows the parts that are different between two files. In the case of a long file, it will save time by not showing code that are the same.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

It is quite common to make mistakes while trying out new things. By having Git, it is easier to go back to previous files when an experiment fails instead of trying to undo all the mistakes you ahve made.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

It makes more logical sense to manually commit as the user would have a better understanding of what changes the file has. By allowing versions to automatically save, it can cause the file to be saved at times where the file isn't able to compile which can end up being more troublesome. However manually committing does run into user error, if the user has bad saving habits then it becomes redundant.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Most of the time in Google docs, the files are independent on one another, therefore it is not necessary to save multiple files in one commit so it doesn't use excess storage. However for Git, code in files are often dependent on other files therefore it is better to commit those files together for ease of use in the future.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log allows you to view the history of a file, while git diff allows you to compare the differences between two commits in the history.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

It makes it much easier to go to a previous version of a file with Git, allowing for changes to be made without worrying about losing the current version.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For coding things
